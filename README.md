# NumberMultiplier

## Description
A console application that, given a comma separated list of strings, 
either prints the result of multiplying the values together or 
squares the numbers being passed in based on user selection. If the user
chooses square, each number in the list is multiplied by itself and then
returned as a comma separated list.

### Example of number multiplication:

`"1,2,3" --> 6`

`"2,4,5" --> 40`

### Example of squares:

`"1,2,3" --> "1,4,9"`

`"2,4,5" --> "4,16,25"`
